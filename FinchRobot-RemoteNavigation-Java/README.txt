This is the project that was created to control a Finch robot by a computer using keyboard keys {A=left, W=forward, S=backwards, D=right}.

This also included the functionality to backtrace previous commands. The code was written in Java within the Eclipse IDE.

The Finch Jar is needed in order for it to work.
