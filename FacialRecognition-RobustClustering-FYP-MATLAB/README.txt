This is my final year project that I completed April 2018.

The folder includes the the technical solution and all other files relating to exploratory data analysis as well as attempted methods of image segmentation.

I have also included my dissertation which you may review in order to understand the purpose and strategies used for this project. 

This project and dissertation overall came back with an A grade.

The appendix mentions the files being on Github (as Wiseflow - for examination purposes). This is not relevant anymore - since the files are now in this directory.
