This project is about exploring different Ai algorithms that can help solve the travelling salesman problem (given the different ranges of datasets - E.g - TSP_48.txt)

The project was created in Eclipse IDE, written in Java.

The different Ai algorithms include:
-Simulated Annealing
-Stochastic Hill climbing
-Random Restart Hill Climbing
-Standard Hill Climbing

Obviously the Simulated Annealing method is better than others at optimizing the best route given the minimum spanning tree calculations.
