Lab10 is the Parameter optimisation of the angle and distance a canon should shoot in order to reach the given target of combat.

Lab12 is the Genetic Algorithm which includes 2 mutation choices (for experimental purposes) - Uniform and OnePoint crossovers. This solution was made to solve the Scales Problem using Search and Fitness optimization methods.

The Scales Problem explanation can be found in the image within this directory - explains the analogy and basic pseudocode.

Solution also available in Python-please request.
Both projects were created using Eclipse IDE, Java.
